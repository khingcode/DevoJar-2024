                <h1>Feeling Lonely?</h1>
                <h2>Psalm 139:1-16, Deuteronomy 31:6, Joshua 1:9</h2>
                <p>Feeling lonely sucks, especially when you miss certain people in your life who can make you feel a lot less “lonely”. This includes close friends, people you’ve just met but had to part ways early, and also, our family. Know that God is always with you, no matter where you are, and no matter what you’re doing. The transition to adulthood might make you feel this a lot more, because we don’t know what God’s plans are for you. You might be far away from home, away from people you’re familiar with, and though you will be able to adjust through time, along the way, the feeling of loneliness will surely find it’s way to you. but a good reminder is that God always sees you amidst your struggles.

                <h1>Amazed</h1>
                <h2>Luke 5:26, Psalm 8:3-4, Romans 11:33</h2>
                <p>In the everyday busyness and distractions of the world, it’s easy to overlook the wonders of God that surround us. Whether big or small, outward, or inward, the wonders of God are always there. When we do notice or when we pause to reflect on the majesty and beauty of God’s creation, we are then filled with awe and amazement like grabe Lord, How? I’m sure there were times when you did your devotionals, there were moments where you were amazed at how God was speaking to you almost in real-time, moments where God answered your prayers and pleas. Since you’re transitioning to adulthood, whether it be during working hours or the down times, know that God is always working behind the scenes.
                    Our reaction would just be like “wow”.

                <h1>Angry</h1>
                <h2>James 1:19-20, Ephesians 4:26-27</h2>
                <p>Anger is mostly seen as a negative emotion, but being Angry isn’t inherently bad. It even states in the bible that anger, and sin are two different things. It says in Ephesians chapter 4(haha), that Anger becomes sin if acted upon. There were instances in the bible where Jesus demonstrated Anger, but what separates his anger from our anger, is our anger is very self-centered. We get angry when something or someone inconveniences us. We get angry when someone lies to us. Our anger is all about us. However, Jesus’ anger is more concerned of God’s holiness. He got angry when he found people exchanging money and selling animals for sacrifice in the temple to the point of driving them out. It’s seen that that behavior is out of character for him, but we see that his reasons of anger is very much different from our reasons.

                <p>Being confident is an admirable trait for most people. The only question is whether we are confident in ourselves or confident because of God.  Just like David who fought Goliath, he was able to go against a mighty giant like him, not because of his confidence on his own skills, but because he had full confidence in God will bring him the victory. Confidence in God is key, and he is the ultimate source of that. </p>

                <p>Confusion happens to everyone, and it is not a state that everyone wants to be in. With confusion comes fear, worry and doubt. The truth is confusion only comes when we do not have the peace of God in us. It is a great reminder that God is our solid ground when we start to feel the confusion settle in. God knows everything from past, present and even future, and so knowing this, we must fully surrender our plans to him so that we may have peace, and make confusion less effective. God is not a God of confusion, and you will know it’s not from God when it does not give you peace. </p>

                <h2>Philippians 4:6-7, Matthew 6:25-34, 1 Peter 5:7</h2>
                <p>The older we get, the more transitions and changes we come across. With that many changes, comes a lot of doubts, worries and even anxieties. May it be meeting new people, in your new place, in your work, or at events. Those emotions might hinder you from forming new bonds, you’ll have a hard time showing how capable you really are, as well as be less expressive and feel like you’re caged. Again, Doubts isn’t the absence of faith, but rather a questioning of faith. It can be a hindrance in our journey toward spiritual growth and maturity. 
                    To counter this, always remember what God has done. We tend to focus on what isn’t happening or what will happen but forget how God worked in your life for you to reach where you are right now.

                <p>I think a great example of someone from the Bible who felt empty, would-be Naomi. It’s noted that the work of God seems to have brought her to a place of emptiness instead of fullness. The same way we might be like Naomi, who left full but came back empty-handed. We can go through seasons where we seem to be emptied out instead of filled up. Know that Naomi’s story didn’t end in chapter one. She may have started empty, but in the end, she came back full of Ruth and Boaz’s child. And sometimes, in our spiritual journey, being emptied is a way for God to rid us of our worldly selves. Whenever you feel empty, remember that we should always seek him, for us to be continually filled with his spirit, presence, and power. In order to be filled, me must be emptied of what makes us currently full.</p>

                I guess one thing we can agree on is that change is scary but at the same time, a bit thrilling and exciting in some sense. There are a lot of instances where people from the bible showed this, but an overlooked person to always exhibit this would be Simon Peter. Remember, when he jumped off the boat, and swam to shore just because he knew Jesus was waiting for him? That’s how excited he was. The same way it shows how much love he has for Jesus, and I pray we exhibit the same thing in everything that Jesus tells us to do. Be excited for what God has in store fr fr

                <p>
                    Transitioning into adulthood is a significant milestone filled with new responsibilities, opportunities, and challenges. I think what comes with this transition is the fear of failure. Whether it's in career, relationships, or personal goals, failure can feel overwhelming and disheartening. However, again, as humans we already fall short of God’s glory, and yet he still loves so much that he sacrificed his son to pay for our sins. Just remember that God is a God of second chances!

                <p>
                    Happiness is such a positive and contagious emotion. You might find yourself searching for happiness in various places—career achievements, relationships, or personal accomplishments. While these can bring temporary joy, the Bible reminds us about a deeper, more enduring source of happiness: a relationship with God. Only true and eternal happiness can be found in Jesus and nothing else!

                    Hope can often feel elusive. I don’t know how many times you’ve thought that there’s no light at the end of the tunnel, or thought “How can God exactly get me out of this struggle? “However, as Christians, our hope is not based on shifting circumstances but on the steadfast love and promises of God.

                Everyone experiences hurt at some point in their lives, whether it be from loss, disappointment, or personal struggles. During these times, it can be challenging to find peace and solace. In your devo time, a great reminder that the Bible provides us with assurances of God's comfort and compassion, especially in our moments of pain.

                <p>
                    In our everyday lives, I feel like patience can often seem like a rare virtue. Whether it's waiting in line, dealing with slow progress, or navigating through life's challenges, impatience can easily settle in, and it’s just L. However, the Bible encourages us to cultivate patience as a vital part of our spiritual growth. I mean.. just think of Job, that guy’s prolly the most patient person ever.

                    Inspiration can come from many places. Feeling inspired is a powerful state of mind that helps us achieve our goals, dreams, and the purpose God has for our lives. As Christians, our inspiration is rooted in the strength and creativity we receive from our relationship with God. I feel like reading any story from the bible, is more than enough to inspire us in a way that we know, God is always behind the scenes cookin’.

                <p>Laziness can often be a hidden obstacle that prevents us from reaching our full potential and fulfilling God’s purposes for our lives. Imagine not being able to give your best and do what he wants us to do because of laziness. NGL, I think most of the time, we don’t reach our full potential because we’re just.. lazy.. that’s literally it</p>

                <p>
                    Love is the very cornerstone of the Christian faith, reflecting the very nature of God. Without love, everything we do is useless and of no value. And we know that God is love, he is the ultimate source of love but are we also applying it to our lives? Love can come in many shapes and sizes, and I think it’s beautiful how we can express love in so many ways, the same way God can demonstrate his love for us.

                    Nostalgia, the longing for the past, can be a powerful and emotional experience. It often recalls cherished memories and significant moments that have shaped our lives. However, nostalgia can also be an opportunity to reflect on God's faithfulness and His mighty works throughout our lives. Nostalgia brings us closer to God, by reflecting on how much he has done in our lives fr, the way he’s just so faithful from the beginning till the end!

                    In a world filled with chaos and uncertainty, finding peace can seem hard to do. However, as Christians, we have access to a profound and enduring peace that comes from our relationship with God. Again, it’s clear to see that the world has no true peace within them, and that’s because they haven’t met and had a personal relationship with God. A GOOD REMINDER FOR US TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL REAL

                <p>
                    Regret is a common human experience, but it doesn't have to define our lives. As much as we regret, there’s close to nothing we can do about the past. It’s a good reminder that God has already forgiven us of our present, future and PAST sins. Ironically, regret also comes from our own disobedience whether it be doing opposite of the convictions from the Holy Spirit, or just generally not taking God’s path for us.

                    Rejection is a painful experience that can leave us feeling alone and unloved. Human perspective is limited, the way we see things is only through our own lens. God’s lens is much much greater than ours, and in that sense, we can fully trust that rejection is just God’s redirection and intervention for us to be where he wants us to be!

                <p>
                    Jesus' invitation to come to Him and find rest is an expression of His compassion and understanding. He knows the weight of our burdens and the weariness of our souls. When we feel overwhelmed by the challenges of life, Jesus urges us to come to Him, promising to lighten our heavy load. JUST REST IN HIS PRESENCE BRUH

                    Sadness is such a weird emotion. As believers, we’re believed to be 24/7 happy people because we have God in our lives. It’s funny but God doesn’t tell us to forcefully put a smile on our face when things are looking down, No. God tells us to rejoice in him no matter what, and it’s a reminder that no matter what our situation is, we can have joy because God is our ultimate source of joy, and not our circumstances.

                    Thankfulness is not merely a response to favorable circumstances; it is a posture of the heart that acknowledges God's goodness and faithfulness in every season of life. Diba it says, in everything, we give thanks to the Lord and as we should because there really isn’t any reason not to thank God for everything we have right now and where we are right now. Everything we have is not ours but God, this includes not only materialistic things, but even friends, family, talents and God-given gifts.
